# Guardian-Pass
The objective of this project is to develop an Enhanced Password Manager that provides users with a secure and efficient way to store, manage, and retrieve their passwords locally without relying on external libraries (except basic Python modules). The system should encrypt all stored passwords using a variable-shift encryption algorithm and require a 4-6 digit master PIN for authentication, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected. Core functionalities include adding, viewing, updating, and deleting passwords, with additional features such as categorizing accounts (e.g., Email, Banking), adding notes, and searching or filtering entries for better organization. The manager should also support importing/exporting password data for backup purposes and maintain an automatic backup system to prevent data loss.

To enhance usability, the application will feature a menu-driven command-line interface (CLI) with clear prompts, hidden password inputs for security, and structured output displays (e.g., tabular lists for accounts, detailed views with timestamps). Robust error handling will ensure input validation, proper PIN verification, and safe file operations. By keeping all data encrypted and stored locally, this password manager eliminates reliance on cloud services, reducing privacy risks while offering a simple yet powerful solution for personal password management. The end result should be a standalone, secure, and user-friendly tool that helps users maintain strong, unique passwords without requiring an internet connection or third-party dependencies.

This project addresses the growing need for secure password storage while prioritizing ease of use, privacy, and offline accessibilityâ€”making it ideal for individuals seeking a lightweight yet reliable alternative to commercial password managers.
