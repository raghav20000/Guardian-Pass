# Guardian-Pass
This project involves creating a secure, self-contained password manager using only Pythonâ€™s standard libraries. It stores all credentials locally with simple encryption to maintain data confidentiality. Access is protected by a user-defined 4-6 digit master PIN, serving as the primary authentication method.
